# Avoid
Avoid is a game created for the 2022-23 FBLA Computer Game & Simulation Programming event. Download the solution and run `Avoid/Program.cs` to start the game. Alternatively, open `Avoid/publish/`, unzip the correct folder for your system (Windows, Linux, or MacOS), and run the `Avoid.exe` file in that folder. Remember that you will have to download *all* the project files if the game is to run correctly.

## Premise
Welcome to Avoid! In this game, you are a rocket trying to escape the inexorable reaches of a black hole, all while dodging obstacles and a giant laser! There is a demo level and five main levels, along with a secret level...
- Avoid hitting obstacles to retain health.
- Use hearts to regain health (maximum 5 lives).
- Coins add to your score.
- A shield will protect you from obstacles and the laser, but it will disappear once the laser deactivates.
- Once collided with, use blast to destroy all obstacles on screen. You can do this three times per blast icon.
- To save your score and view your ranking, open the leaderboard from the menu page. The score is calculated as the sum of the high score from each level.

## User Interface
Avoid is designed as a PC game in the style of an arcade game, although it can be extended to various platforms. Use your keyboard and mouse or an Xbox gamepad (if you want more of an arcade feel!) to play. 

## Credits
